## Project Plan
```
Hereâ€™s a simple and clear **project plan** for your web app, broken into **main tasks** and **technical considerations**:

---

### **Project Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Project Setup**
1. **Create Project Folder:**
   - Set up a folder for the project with the following files:
     - `index.html` (HTML structure)
     - `styles.css` (CSS styling)
     - `script.js` (JavaScript logic)
   - Add an `images` folder to store zodiac images.

2. **Define Data Structure:**
   - Create the `zodiacData` array in `script.js` to store information for all zodiac signs (as shown in the example).

---

#### **Phase 2: HTML Structure**
1. **Build the Dropdown Menu:**
   - Add a `<select>` element with `<option>` tags for each zodiac sign in `index.html`.

2. **Create Placeholders for Displaying Information:**
   - Add placeholders for the zodiac image and details (e.g., characteristics, element, etc.) in `index.html`.

---

#### **Phase 3: CSS Styling**
1. **Style the Dropdown and Layout:**
   - Use `styles.css` to style the dropdown, ensuring it is user-friendly and visually appealing.
   - Design the layout for displaying the zodiac image and information in a clean and organized manner.

2. **Make the App Responsive:**
   - Use CSS media queries to ensure the app works well on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

---

#### **Phase 4: JavaScript Logic**
1. **Add Event Listeners:**
   - Add a `change` event listener to the dropdown in `script.js` to detect user selection.

2. **Dynamically Update Display:**
   - Write logic to update the image and information dynamically based on the userâ€™s selection using the `zodiacData` array.

---

#### **Phase 5: Testing**
1. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
   - Test the app on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure compatibility.

2. **Functionality Testing:**
   - Verify all features (dropdown, image display, and information updates) work as expected.

---

### **Technical Considerations**
1. **File Naming and Organization:**
   - Ensure images are named consistently and match the `image` property in `zodiacData`.
   - Organize files and folders logically for easy maintenance.

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Compress zodiac images to reduce loading time.
   - Minify CSS and JavaScript files for production (optional, if time permits).

3. **Accessibility:**
   - Add `alt` attributes to images for accessibility.
   - Ensure the dropdown and information display are navigable via keyboard.

---

### **Timeline**
- **Day 1: Setup and HTML Structure**
  - Create the project folder, HTML file, and data structure.
  
- **Day 2: CSS Styling**
  - Style the dropdown and layout, focusing on responsiveness.

- **Day 3: JavaScript Logic**
  - Implement event listeners and dynamic updates.

- **Day 4: Testing and Refinement**
  - Test the app across browsers and devices, fix any issues.

---

### **Deliverables**
1. A fully functional web app with a dropdown menu for zodiac selection.
2. Dynamic display of zodiac image and information based on user selection.
3. A clean, responsive, and visually appealing design.
